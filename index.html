    <h1>Hello, I'm <span>Stephen Nash Aguilar</span></h1>
    <p>A Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student at the University of the Cordilleras, passionate about web development, computer networking, and system troubleshooting. Driven by purpose, guided by growth.</p>

  <!-- ===== ABOUT ===== -->
  <section class="section" id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-text">
      <p>My story begins on the day I was born — a small child with big dreams, growing up in a simple yet warm environment where my family taught me the values of patience, humility, and perseverance. I wasn’t born into luxury, but I was surrounded by love and support that shaped me into who I am today. As a child, I was curious about everything — always asking questions, touching gadgets, and wondering how things worked.</p>

      <p>I remember the first time I sat in front of a computer. The glowing screen, the sound of the keyboard, and the world that appeared through the monitor amazed me. From that moment, I knew that technology was something I wanted to understand. I spent hours exploring, learning, and experimenting, not realizing that I was slowly building the foundation of what would become my passion.</p>

      <p>Growing up, I wasn’t the smartest in class, but I was determined. Every challenge I faced became a lesson — every failure, a motivation to rise stronger. There were times I doubted myself, times I felt lost, but I always found strength in remembering why I started. My curiosity for computers became my direction, and my dream started to take shape — to become a web developer who builds something that people can use, enjoy, and learn from.</p>

      <p>Now, as a Web Technology student, I continue to discover the beauty of coding and design. Learning how websites are made, how systems work, and how technology connects people makes me excited for what’s ahead. It’s not just about codes and screens for me — it’s about creating something meaningful, something that reflects who I am and what I stand for.</p>

      <p>Looking back, I’m proud of how far I’ve come. From a curious child fascinated by gadgets to a young adult determined to make a mark in the digital world — my journey is still unfolding. And as I continue to learn and grow, I hold on to one belief: that with passion, dedication, and faith, I can turn my dreams into reality, one line of code at a time.</p>
